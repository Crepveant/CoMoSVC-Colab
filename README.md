A consistency model based Singing Voice Conversion system is composed, which is inspired by [CoMoSpeech](https://github.com/zhenye234/CoMoSpeech): One-Step Speech and Singing Voice Synthesis via Consistency Model.

This is an implemention of the paper [CoMoSVC](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01792.pdf).
